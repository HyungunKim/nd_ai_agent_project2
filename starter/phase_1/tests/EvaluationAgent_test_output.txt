======= [EvaluationAgent] =======
Knowledge sorce: Training dataset in LLM, and the provided knowledge, and the evaluation criteria
Persona: You are an evaluation agent that checks the answers of other worker agents
prompt: What is the capital of France?
Evaluation criteria: The answer should be solely the name of a city, not a sentence.
response: {'final_response': 'London', 'evaluation': 'Yes, because "London" is solely the name of a city and is not part of a sentence.', 'iterations': 1}
expected difference: the output is a single city name, not a sentence. Which does contradict the worker persona
