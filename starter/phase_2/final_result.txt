  - **Estimated Effort:** 20 story points  
  - **Dependencies:** Email data set for NLP training; response templates  

- **T2: Implement Email Classification and Routing Engine**  
  - **Related User Story:** Categorize emails and route them appropriately to reduce manual triage.  
  - **Description:** Create a classification engine to categorize incoming emails and routing logic to direct them appropriately, reducing manual triage.  
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - Emails are classified into predefined categories with at least 90% accuracy.  
    - Routing logic directs emails to correct queues or agents based on classification.  
    - System integrates with email infrastructure APIs for seamless processing.  
  - **Estimated Effort:** 25 story points  
  - **Dependencies:** Completion of T1; access to email infrastructure APIs  

**Feature 2: Complex Inquiry Routing and Accuracy**

- **T3: Develop Complex Inquiry Identification and Context Aggregation Module**

  - **Description:** Implement logic to detect complex inquiries, extract metadata, and route emails with full context to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).  
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - Complex inquiries are identified with at least 85% precision and recall.  
    - Relevant metadata is extracted and attached to routed emails.  
    - Routed emails include full context for SME review.  
  - **Estimated Effort:** 18 story points  
  - **Dependencies:** Completion of T2; metadata schema availability  

- **T4: Enhance Routing Accuracy to Minimize Misdirected Emails**  
  - **Related User Story:** Reduce misdirected emails and improve routing accuracy.  
  - **Description:** Analyze misdirected emails, implement corrective routing logic, develop a feedback mechanism for users to report misrouted emails, and optimize routing algorithms.  
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - Routing accuracy improves to at least 90%, reducing misdirected emails by 50%.  
    - Feedback mechanism allows users to report misrouted emails.  
    - Routing algorithms are updated based on feedback and analysis.  
  - **Estimated Effort:** 15 story points  
  - **Dependencies:** Completion of T3; feedback system infrastructure  

**Feature 3: IT Administrator System Management and Security**

- **T5: Design and Develop Real-Time Performance Dashboard**  
  - **Related User Story:** Provide IT Administrators with real-time system monitoring tools.  
  - **Description:** Create a dashboard displaying real-time metrics such as response times and routing accuracy with dynamic updates and drill-downs.  
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - Dashboard displays up-to-date metrics with refresh intervals under 30 seconds.  
    - Users can drill down into detailed views of performance data.  
    - Dashboard is accessible via secure admin interface.  
  - **Estimated Effort:** 12 story points  
  - **Dependencies:** Data modules from T2 and T4; UI framework  

- **T6: Implement Configuration Management Interfaces**  
  - **Related User Story:** Enable IT Administrators to manage knowledge base, routing rules, and system settings.  
  - **Description:** Develop interfaces with versioning and rollback capabilities for configuration management.  
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - Admins can create, update, and rollback configurations.  
    - Changes are logged with user and timestamp information.  
    - Interface is user-friendly and secure.  
  - **Estimated Effort:** 20 story points  
  - **Dependencies:** Completion of T2 and T3; configuration database schema  

- **T7: Implement Role-Based Access Control and Multi-Factor Authentication**  
  - **Related User Story:** Secure system access for IT Administrators and other users.  
  - **Description:** Design and implement RBAC and MFA mechanisms including admin interfaces and security testing.  
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    - RBAC enforces access permissions according to defined roles.  
    - MFA is required for all admin-level access.  
    - Security testing confirms no unauthorized access is possible.  
  - **Estimated Effort:** 15 story points  
  - **Dependencies:** Authentication service; security policies  

Each task is defined by what needs to be built to fulfill the corresponding user story, specifying modules, features, integrations, acceptance criteria, estimated effort, and dependencies.
