This structured definition of development tasks includes all required fields to guide scheduling, resource allocation, and acceptance testing aligned with user stories and product objectives.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No.

Reason: While the answer provides detailed development tasks with Task ID, Task Title, Related User Story, Acceptance Criteria, Estimated Effort, and Dependencies, it does not strictly follow the requested structure because:

- The field "Description" is missing; instead, the answer uses "Objective" which is similar but not exactly the requested "Description" field.
- The order of fields is inconsistent with the requested structure.
- Some fields are combined or labeled differently (e.g., "Objective" instead of "Description").

Therefore, it does not fully meet the exact structure criteria specified.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the answer, please do the following:

1. Replace the field labeled "Objective" with the exact field name "Description" to match the requested structure.
2. Ensure the order of fields strictly follows the requested sequence. For example, if the requested order is Task ID, Task Title, Description, Related User Story, Acceptance Criteria, Estimated Effort, Dependencies, arrange the fields accordingly.
3. Avoid combining or renaming fields; use the exact field names as specified without merging or altering them.
4. Review the entire answer to confirm all tasks consistently follow the exact field names and order as requested.

By making these adjustments, the answer will fully comply with the specified structure requirements.

 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No.

Reason: The answer does not follow the exact order of fields as required. The required order is: Task ID, Task Title, Related User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Estimated Effort, and Dependencies. However, in the provided answer, the "Description" field appears before the "Related User Story" field. This violates the specified order criterion.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the answer, reorder the fields to strictly follow the required sequence: Task ID, Task Title, Related User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Estimated Effort, and Dependencies. Specifically, move the "Description" field so that it comes after the "Related User Story" field, not before it. Ensure no other fields are out of order.
 Step 5: Send feedback to worker agent for refinement

 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No.

Reason: While the answer provides task IDs, titles, descriptions, and acceptance criteria, it does not include the required elements of "Related User Story," "Estimated Effort," or "Dependencies" for each task. Therefore, it does not fully meet the specified structure criteria.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the answer, please revise each task entry to include the following missing elements:

1. Related User Story: Specify which user story the task is associated with.
2. Estimated Effort: Provide an estimate of the effort required to complete the task (e.g., in hours or story points).
3. Dependencies: List any tasks or conditions that must be completed or met before this task can begin.

Ensure that every task includes all these elements along with the existing task ID, title, description, and acceptance criteria to fully meet the specified structure criteria.
