This is the output where all routing agent can take two inputs.
One input is short description for the task to select the right worker agent.
Second input is longer descrition of the task. This could include context of previous steps.
The end result seems okay but (step3) had developer agent prematurely making task befure program manager can have a say.
Fortunately the final step was handled by developer agent again with the compete context.
